    <h1>Background Research</h1>
    <p>For the final project, I want to focus on the problems in diversity in regards to facial recognition. I am curious to explore why facial recognition seems to be less developed for people of color in comparison to Caucasian faces. Specifically, my case study will be utilizing Google’s Arts and Culture App, which unrolled a selfie feature to get people interested in fine art. According to Nunez in his article, “The Google Arts and Culture App Has a Race Problem,” Nunez asserts the idea that the app uses artificial intelligence data to match facial features to fine artwork, but historically, art collectors have massively catered towards Eurocentric art history.
    </p>

    <p>In my opinion, it would be strongest to create an app or program that can simultaneously recognize racial differences and apply them to a database or artwork. Therefore, even if there was a lack in database material, the program would still be able to recognize crucial elements of a person’s identity.
    </p>

      To understand more about facial recognition, I researched how it was developed and how it was currently being used. Bon-Woo Hwang’s study on the human face acknowledged the difficulties in artificial recognition since external factors like lighting or angle could affect the results. Nonetheless, Hwang’s study utilized a large, developed Korean face database in order to test the artificial intelligence program’s effects. It is important to note that Hwang’s experiment used a specifically Korean facial database whereas other tech companies, like Google, most likely utilize a mostly-Eurocentric face database. It would be best to convince companies to utilize more facial databases to be as inclusive as possible.

      Hwang’s experiment concluded with the fact that three-dimensional facial models were the most successful in artificial intelligence software facial recognition. This fact is compelling because apps like Google’s Arts and Culture App focuses on two-dimensional imagery. It would be interesting to map out three-dimensional features and apply the idea to sculptural artworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking my research further, I looked into challenges and difficulties that facial recognition technology has run into to consider a holistic approach to my final project. Zahid Akhtar, in his article “A Face in any Form: New Challenges and Opportunities for Face Recognition Technology,” brought up the idea that facial recognition is affected by superficial factors like heavy makeup, plastic surgery, or aging. While not completely on-topic, it was also interesting that Akhtar’s article raised critical points about privacy, which is a growing concern in the tech world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Akhtar also makes the claim that there is no biometric that will allow artificial intelligence to recognize individuality, but like Hwang, Akhtar agrees that using three-dimensional models has a higher success rate than two-dimensional models. In this case, it would be interesting to see a virtual reality or augmented reality version of facial recognition.
    </p>

        <p>
          Seemingly, facial recognition does not work one way or another for minority faces because of a lack of data, but I do not accept this as a good reason. Since I am completely unfamiliar with facial recognition technology, it would be interesting (and within my abilities) to specifically code a program that organizes certain artworks by geography so that it is possible to start building a database of more diverse art works. Another way to possibly critique both the tech industry and the canon of art history would be to research the statistics of how many different artists are included in Google’s database or in art museums in general and to break down the statistics by gender, race, and other factors. While this would not solve the diversity in design problem directly, I feel that the critique would be a critical look at both design and art history.
