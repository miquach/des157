    <p>
    The storyboard focuses on a user that will interact with my project in an art museum setting. The window console will ask how many famous paintings are from what geographic location. I plan on using data visualization to skew a map or show pinpoints of where the top 20 or top 50 famous paintings are originally from. The goal of the project is to make the user examine why/how many diverse people are included in art history. In the end, there will be a user-interaction option for the user to take their photo and add it onto the map to include themselves in the contemporary canon of art. I have plans to filter their image to mimic a painting style or art period, but will look more into the idea, as I don't want my project to look too corny.
