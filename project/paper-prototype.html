    <p>
    My paper prototypes are shown above. In my first prototype, I was concerned that the interface was too simple, so I created multiple windows to simplify the "about" and "purpose" information about my project. In my mind, I was envisioning that by separating the information, it would be easier for the user to read through the project. In my second prototype, I received feedback from Glenda and Tammy that the extra window and extra buttons were confusing and extraneous. In my second prototype, I took out the extra screens and button and put the extra information in a smaller button in case the user wanted to learn more about my project. Glenda also brought up the question of how the menu would be clickable/selectable through a virtual reality environment. As such, I re-did my prototypes to include a kind of pop-up box overlay instead of having a full screen page in the beginning.
