    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>My final project topic is the critique of a traditionally Eurocentric art history by simulating a recreation of Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Rooms in a virtual reality (VR) space. By creating a virtual reality space, the goal is to bring awareness to (female) artists of color. Furthermore, the work will be on the Internet, which is a commonly open-access, more accessible space to reach than a fine-arts museum. It is also notable to mention that the virtual reality space is much more accessible to the common public than a sold out art gallery, which Kusama’s works frequently exist in (through no fault of her own, but it would be compelling to see fine art being made more accessible to the public).
    </p>
    <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
    <p>My project primarily targets the millennial generation, but I have identified people with mobility issues or the mobility-impaired/disabled as a secondary audience. The millennial generation will be concerned with diversity issues, be tech-savvy, and on-trend, so a VR infinity room with the goal of ultimately criticizing the lack of diverse artists and democratizing fine art will be of interest to them. Within this group, I am specifically targeting people who are interested in art history and contemporary art but do not have the social, financial, or other means to visit the art in an art museum.</p>
    <p>My secondary audience are mobility-impaired people. While I was attending the Yayoi Kusama rooms at the Broad in Los Angeles, I was behind a person in a wheelchair and saw how difficult it was to maneuver around the museum. I would like to recreate the infinity rooms in a VR space to give them the option of experiencing the art by their own terms.
</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>My project goals are to bring the snob-like, exclusivity of the fine art world and bring it into a more accessible language to the public. I am also interested in showcasing the contemporary works of artists of color, so I have chosen Yayoi Kusama to model my VR room after. Users will be able to experience Kusama’s infinity mirror rooms in the comfort of their own choosing and without the steep financial price or travel accommodations needed to go to an art exhibit.
</p>
<h2>Goals for Overall Look and Feel</h2>
<p>The project’s overall look will be contemporary, clean, and fresh. I plan on using typefaces like Gotham or Lato or another geometric sans-serif font in order to maintain a clean and professional look. For graphics, I plan on utilizing the threejs library and using the scene and render functions to create the stars of the room. I also plan on creating star graphics for the background. I plan on using a monochromatic color palette and having the “lights” periodically dim, similar to the real experience of the infinity rooms. It is the project’s goal to recreate the infinity rooms as best as possible in order to provide the most realistic VR experience for the project’s users.</p>
<p>I want the overall feel of the project to convey a deep sense of self-identity through the cosmos as Kusama intended with her work. I want to correctly pay homage to Kusama’s work while simultaneously bringing her work into a greater sphere of influence.</p>
