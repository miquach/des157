                <h1>infinity page</h1>
                <p>"Infinity Page" is based on Yayoi Kusama's series, <em>Infinity Mirrors</em>. Kusama utilizes mirrors to create an experiential transcendence beyond the physical realm. The rooms have a dreamy, psychedelic aesthetic, which multicolored
                    lights flickering in and out of a cosmos-room. <br> <br>Her work explores our shared feelings of identity, infinity, interconnectivity, life, and death of the self.<br><br> This project aims to digitize her work, bringing accessibility
                    to an otherwise difficult-to-see show. It is not the goal of this project to claim ownership over her work, but rather it is part of a larger effort to extend diversity and accessibility in an exclusive art world by utilizing the open
                    access, open-resource culture of web design and coding. The project further aims to examine the art's selfie-culture debate and examine the zeitgeist appeal of Instagram culture. Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms have reached an
                    unprecedented scale of popularity, with some curators attributing the reason to the rise of social media. There is something about capturing and sharing the immersive beauty of the infinite despite the lack of reproducibility contained
                    in the physicality of Kusama's rooms.<br><br>All in all, there's something to be said about the repetition echoed in Kusama's mirrors and the repetition that exists in sharing the photos online.<br><br>"Infinity Page" mimics Yayoi
                    Kusama's <em>The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away (2013).</em></p>
